\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em num} & is the user entered integer \\
\hline
{\em s} & is a starting position from which bit inverstion will take place \\
\hline
{\em c} & is a count of bit to get inverted \\
\hline
{\em mask} & it creates mask for XOR operation and have 1s form stating position and for given count \\
\hline
{\em a} & output value is stored in this after the XOR opertaion of given integer and created mask \\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
